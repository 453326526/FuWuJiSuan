I walk these streets,searching to find 
The steps that we left behind 
Your lonely eyes stare back at mine 
In pictures from that time 
I hold my heart,closing my eyes 
I see your smile,lies behind 
In this place,you entered my life 
How I wish,you were still mine 
I know that if I see you again 
Beside that cafe we met 
I had forget about the past 
Lose track of time,with you 
Talking about our lives 
To show you a whole new side of me 
And see the changes we£§ve made,can we 
Be more than we have been 
Start our story again 
All I can say,is tell you just one thing 
I hold my heart,closing my eyes 
I see your smile,lies behind 
In this place,you entered my life 
How I wish,you were still mine 
I know that if I see you again 
Beside that cafe we met 
I had forget about the past 
Lose track of time,with you 
Talking about our lives 
To show you a whole new side of me 
And see the changes we£§ve made,can we 
Be more than we have been 
Start our story again 
All I can say,is tell you just one thing
